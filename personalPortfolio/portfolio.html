  <p class = "my-title">I'm a junior backend developer who loves 
      solving problems and building solutions.
  </p>
  <p class = "intro">Coming from a commerce background with 
      a BCom degree in Information Systems and Economics, I immediately 
      delved deep into the realm of Software Engineering and I haven't 
     looked back since. 
  </p>
  <p class = "intro">During my studies, I found it hard to picture 
      myself working in that field indefinitily. I wanted a career I could picture 
      myself going to everyday. Once I had made that decision, I had to get out 
      of my comfort zone and learn a technical skill which I never thought was 
      in the cards for me.
  </p>
  <p class = "intro"> I live by 2 core values (that I may or may not 
    have made up); knowleadge-seeking and knowleadge-gifting. I aim to 
    continuously upskill myself and learn more about the field that I 
    love and I aspire to gift the knowledge that I have amassed to those
    who are growing up in communities such as I did.
